Proximity Audio Alarm - V 1.0
=============================

The Proximity Part
==================

The part, called 'Proximity', is found under the science tab. It looks suspiciously like the thermometer. It has zero mass and drag.

The part is activated when the ship is below a certain height (default is 2000m) which the pilot can configure. When active, a visual alert and an audio alarm are produced to inform the pilot of the height above the surface and velocity towards it.

Audio Alarm
===========

The audio alarm makes beeps to indicate height above the surface. The beeps become more frequent the closer to the surface the ship is. If the 'Variable frequency' mode is selected, the beeps rise in pitch as the ship moves faster. The alarm can be configured to beep always, or only when descending.

The length of the beep and its waveform can be set to match user preference and fit in with other game sounds.

The audio alarm can be turned off altogether.

Visual Display
==============

The visual display shows a horizontal line with two moving blobs to indicate the ship's distance from the terrain below. It can operate in two modes.

In 'Distance' mode, the distance between the blobs corresponds to the ship's height above the surface, so during a descent the blobs start at opposite ends of the line and move towards the centre, meeting when the ship is at ground level.

In 'Speed' mode, the blobs start in the centre and move apart if the ship is moving upwards, and start at the ends and meet in the middle if it is moving downwards. The speed of the blobs increases as the ship gets closer to the gound.

The display can also be set to use distance mode above a certain threshold height, and speed mode below it. If this mixed mode is selected, a field to set the threshold height appears.

The visual display can be turned off altogether.

Known Issues
============
In planets with an atmosphere (where the ship is in 'situation == FLYING') the altitude used is the height above sea level, so if you are landing on a mountain higeer than the activation threshold, the Proximity part will not activate at all, even when you've hit the ground. Sorry about that.

This is not a problem for planets/moons without an atmosphere (where 'situation == SUB_ORBITAL'). I am trying to find a way to get the correct altitude on planets with atmospheres, and there will be an update if/when that happens.
